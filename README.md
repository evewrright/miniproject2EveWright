# Mini Project 2

## Description

This project utilizes a .csv dataset sourced from Kaggle, importing it into a Pandas dataframe for analysis. 
The dataset contains 35 fields of student demographic and academic information, with each record representing an individual student.
Using matplotlib, the project generates visualizations to address key questions about student academic success. 
These visualizations are then saved as PNG files and stored in a folder named "charts".

Please note that the institution from which this data was sourced is not an American institution and therefore 
uses different grading scales, higher ed terminology. etc.

## Getting Started

### PIP Install Instructions

* Please run the following
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

* Download the [Higher Education Predictors of Student Success Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention?resource=download)
as a CSV and name it 'dataset'. Then, add the dataset.csv file to this repository.

### Executing program

* In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
python main.py
```
