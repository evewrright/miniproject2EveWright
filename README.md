# Mini Project 2

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

This project uses a .csv dataset from Kaggle and stores it in a Pandas dataframe. The dataset consists of
35 fields of student demographic and academic information where each record is a single student.
It then utilizes matplotlib to graph this data and visually answer some of our questions about the dataset. Finally,
this project will save all of these graphs as PNG files and save them to a folder called "charts".
